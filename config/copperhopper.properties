# nbtMatchEnabledIds is a whitespace-separated list of item ids.  Listed items will be a filtering match
# only if their nbt data also matches.
#
# This means that the enchantments will have to line up, which is (probably) desirable if you're
# filtering enchanted books (to sort them by enchantment) but maybe less so if you're sorting diamond
# swords (where you probably want to match all of them regardless of enchantment.
#
# Remember that you always need to keep one empty slot in the copper hopper in order for matching
# non-stackable items to pass into it.
